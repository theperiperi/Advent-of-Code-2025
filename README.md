# Advent of Code 2025 🎄

It's that time of the year again :))

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025) is an annual coding event created by Eric Wastl that runs from December 1st through December 12th (starting in 2025, it's 12 days instead of the traditional 25). Each day, a new two-part programming puzzle is released at midnight EST. These puzzles can be solved in any programming language and are designed to be fun challenges that range from beginner-friendly to quite complex.

### How It Works

1. **Daily Puzzles**: Each day unlocks a new puzzle with two parts
   - Part 1: Solve the initial challenge to earn one gold star ⭐
   - Part 2: A continuation or twist on Part 1 that unlocks after completing Part 1, earning a second star ⭐

2. **Personal Input**: Each user gets unique puzzle input data from the website
   - You must be logged in to get your personalized input
   - Your input is different from other users' inputs, but the puzzle logic is the same

3. **Solutions**: Submit your answers on the website to check if they're correct
   - You get immediate feedback on whether your answer is right or wrong
   - There's no penalty for wrong answers (except a brief timeout)

## Repository Structure

```
Advent-of-Code-2025/
├── day1/
│   ├── input.txt      # Your personal puzzle input (not tracked in git)
│   ├── part1.py       # Solution for Day 1, Part 1
│   └── part2.py       # Solution for Day 1, Part 2
├── day2/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── part1.py
│   └── part2.py
└── ...
```

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Running Solutions

1. **Get your puzzle input**:
   - Go to [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)
   - Log in with your account
   - Navigate to the day you want to solve
   - Copy your puzzle input and save it as `input.txt` in the corresponding day folder

2. **Run a solution**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to the specific day folder
   cd day1
   
   # Run Part 1
   python part1.py
   
   # Run Part 2
   python part2.py
   ```

3. **Alternative - Run from project root**:
   ```bash
   # Run Part 1 of Day 1
   python day1/part1.py
   
   # Run Part 2 of Day 1
   python day1/part2.py
   ```

### Notes

- Each solution reads from `input.txt` in its respective day folder
- The `input.txt` files are gitignored since they contain personal puzzle inputs
- Solutions are self-contained and can be run independently
